Welcome to the Survey Builder UI repository! This web application allows you to create, edit, manage, and analyze surveys seamlessly. It provides a user-friendly interface for building surveys, adding questions, and collecting responses. The application is currently deployed at [surveyui.knowankit.com](https://surveyui.knowankit.com), allowing you to easily access and utilize its features.

## Features

### Create a Survey
Easily create new surveys using an intuitive interface. Define the survey title, description, and other relevant details.

### Add Questions
Add a variety of question types to your survey, such as multiple-choice, open-text, ratings, and more. Customize each question's options and settings according to your needs.

### Edit and Delete Surveys
Effortlessly edit existing surveys to make changes to titles, descriptions, and questions. You can also delete surveys that are no longer needed.

### Publish and Unpublish Surveys
Control the visibility of your surveys by publishing or unpublishing them. Published surveys are accessible to respondents, while unpublished surveys remain hidden.
